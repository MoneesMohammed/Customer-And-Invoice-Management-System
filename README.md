# Customer & Invoice Management System
A complete Customer & Invoice Management System built using C# WinForms, SQL Server, and ADO.NET.
The system implements full CRUD operations for customers, products, invoices, and payments.


This project is a customer and invoice management system designed as a professional transactional system.

Through it, you can register customers, register users (employees), register products, create invoices linked to existing customers in the system, and record payments linked to the invoice . All of this is saved in the database.

It was built for learning purposes and follows the **3-Tier Architecture** pattern: 

- **Presentation Layer** → Windows Forms (UI).  
- **Business Layer** → Business logic (rules, validations, workflows).  
- **Data Layer** → Database access (ADO.NET).
